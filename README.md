# Hitesh - Web Dev II - Portfolio

## Project Explaination
 The project is based on the mockup design which I created in my UX course. The project follows the same high fidelity mockup style into a full working website created totally on html and css. The website all have used bootstrap elements as per the guidelines and instructions. Overall, Its a great portfolio piece to showcase in Future.

### Challenges
- Using Bootstrap for the first time- Using bootstrap was a bit difficult then expected but moreover most of the    complex elements were easy to make with the help of bootstrap
- Using JS library for scroll
- Images issue- The images used in this site were all shot by myself and were of great quality, thats what made the work difficult as because of high quality of the images the website took long time to load and refresh. This issue was fixed by reducing the size and including picture tag to make the images more responsive.

### Lessons Learned
- Using Bootstrap Grid effectively - Learning bootstrap grid was difficult but when used adequately it can ease out your work in a very effective manner.
- How to add libraries to your project- Using JS libraries was fun to use and made the site look more attractive.
- Working on Complex Projects - This assignment helped me learn how to work effectively on complex multiple pages websites which is a crucial part for a web developer.
